# DAA-Project
The Design and Analysis of Algorithms Course deals with the design of algorithms from both theoretical and practical honesty by striving to offer new solutions to complex algorithms. Resulting into n-ary trees, AVL trees, tries, graphs, skip lists, and finally basic algorithms that cover, sorting, backtracking, string matching, and finding the shortest paths.

Assignments are intended to cover the gap between theory and application, such as leveraging data structures for optimizing a submission system with tries, creating recommendation engines, and enhancing memory management through user-defined heaps. It instills a sense of algorithmic intuition and empirical systematic problem solving into engineers that empower them to design efficient algorithms and improve existing solutions for real-life challenges.
